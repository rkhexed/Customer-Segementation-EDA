# Customer-Segementation-EDA
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on customer segmentation data, identifying key patterns and trends that led to the segmentation of customers into groups such as 'champions', 'loyal customers', and 'at risk', resulting in targeted strategies to improve customer retention and streamline sales efforts across multiple countries. You can view the output and code on the .ipynb file and download the Power BI file to see the data visualisation post EDA.
